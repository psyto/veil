## Initial Engagement Tweet

**Option A: Direct Thank You**
```
Thanks for the follow @QuickNode!

Building ShadowLaunch - privacy-first token purchases on @pumpdotfun for their $3M hackathon.

Using QuickNode for high-performance RPC. Privacy + speed = no compromise.

Would love to chat about Solana privacy infrastructure.

```

**Option B: Building in Public**
```
Building in public for @pumpdotfun hackathon

ShadowLaunch: Buy tokens without leaving a trace.

Tech stack:
- @QuickNode for blazing fast RPC
- ZK compression via @LightProtocol
- Ephemeral wallets for unlinkability

Privacy shouldn't slow you down.

Demo soon.
```

**Option C: Technical Focus**
```
Why we chose @QuickNode for ShadowLaunch:

- Sub-100ms response times
- 99.99% uptime
- Global edge network
- Solana-optimized

When building privacy tools, RPC reliability is non-negotiable. Every failed request is a UX disaster.

Building for @pumpdotfun hackathon.

## Progress Update Tweets

**After Initial Setup**
```
ShadowLaunch dev update:

✅ Shadow mode toggle
✅ Ephemeral wallet generation
✅ @QuickNode RPC integration
✅ Token browser UI

Next: Shielded transfer flow

Building privacy-first Pump.fun purchases.

@pumpdotfun hackathon submission incoming.
```

**Technical Deep Dive**
```
How ShadowLaunch breaks wallet-token links:

1. SOL → Privacy pool (visible)
2. Unshield → Fresh keypair (link broken)
3. Purchase → Pump.fun (public but unlinked)

Result: Tokens in wallet with NO trace to you.

## Asking for Support

**RPC Credits Request**
```
Hey @QuickNode team!

Building ShadowLaunch for @pumpdotfun $3M hackathon - privacy-first token purchases on Solana.

Already integrated QuickNode as recommended RPC provider.

Any chance of hackathon RPC credits? Would love to demo on mainnet without rate limits.

DM open!
```

**Case Study Offer**
```
.@QuickNode - would you be interested in a case study?

Building ShadowLaunch: privacy infrastructure for @pumpdotfun

Unique angle: Privacy-preserving dApp requiring ultra-reliable RPC (every failed request = privacy leak)

Happy to share architecture + metrics.

DM me!
```

## Launch/Demo Tweets

**Demo Announcement**

## Engagement Replies

**When QuickNode tweets about Solana:**
```
This is why we chose @QuickNode for ShadowLaunch!

Building privacy-first Pump.fun purchases - RPC reliability is critical when every request matters.

Excited to be building on your infra.
```

**When QuickNode mentions DeFi/privacy:**
```
Privacy + performance is our thesis at ShadowLaunch.

Using @QuickNode because you can't have privacy without reliability.

Happy to share more about what we're building for @pumpdotfun hackathon!

## DM Templates

**Initial DM to QuickNode**

Hi QuickNode team!

Thanks for following - really appreciate it!

I'm building ShadowLaunch for the Pump.fun hackathon ($3M, 12 winners). It's privacy-first token purchases on Solana.

Already integrated QuickNode as the recommended RPC provider in our docs and codebase.

Would love to:
1. Chat about potential hackathon support (RPC credits?)
2. Discuss being featured as a case study
3. Get any feedback on our architecture

Happy to share a demo anytime.

Best,
[Your name]

**Follow-up DM**
```
Hi again!

Quick update - ShadowLaunch is progressing well:
- Shadow mode working end-to-end
- QuickNode integration tested on mainnet
- Demo ready for review

Would love 15 mins to show you what we've built. Any interest?

Also happy to write up a technical blog post about using QuickNode for privacy infrastructure if that's useful for your content.

Let me know!
