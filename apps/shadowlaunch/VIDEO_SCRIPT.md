## FULL SCRIPT

### INTRO + HOOK (0:00 - 0:30)
*[Camera: You, talking directly to camera]*

> "Hi, I'm [YOUR NAME], founder of ShadowLaunch.
>
> I'm a [YOUR BACKGROUND - e.g., software engineer, crypto trader, etc.] and I've been building on Solana for [X time].
>
> Here's a question: Have you ever found alpha on Pump.fun, bought a token, and then watched copy traders front-run you within seconds?
>
> That's because every transaction you make is completely public. Your wallet is a glass house.
>
> ShadowLaunch fixes this."

---

### THE PROBLEM (0:30 - 1:00)
*[Camera: You, or switch to screen showing wallet tracker]*

> "Let me show you the problem.
>
> *[Show Solscan/Birdeye wallet page]*
>
> This is what anyone can see about your trading. Every buy, every sell, every token you touch.
>
> Wallet trackers like Nansen, Arkham, and hundreds of Telegram bots monitor profitable wallets 24/7.
>
> The moment you buy, bots copy you. Market makers see your order and front-run.
>
> Your edge disappears instantly.
>
> For serious traders, this isn't just annoying - it's costing real money."

---

### THE SOLUTION (1:00 - 1:30)
*[Camera: You]*

> "ShadowLaunch solves this with one simple idea: ephemeral wallets.
>
> Instead of buying directly from your main wallet, ShadowLaunch:
>
> One - Creates a fresh wallet with zero history.
> Two - Transfers your SOL through a privacy layer.
> Three - Makes the purchase from that new wallet.
>
> The result? Tokens in a wallet that has absolutely no on-chain connection to you.
>
> No one can track you. No one can copy you. Your alpha stays yours."

---

### DEMO (1:30 - 2:00)
*[Screen recording of ShadowLaunch app]*

> "Let me show you how it works.
>
> *[Show app, click Start Trading]*
>
> Connect your wallet like normal.
>
> *[Toggle Shadow Mode]*
>
> Toggle Shadow Mode - see the green indicator? You're now in private mode.
>
> *[Click on a token]*
>
> Pick any token. Enter your amount.
>
> *[Show purchase panel]*
>
> When you click Shadow Buy, a fresh ephemeral wallet is created just for this purchase.
>
> Your main wallet never touches the token. Zero trace."

---

### PROGRESS + ROADMAP (2:00 - 2:30)
*[Camera: You]*

> "Here's where we are today:
>
> We have a fully working prototype. The UI is live. The ephemeral wallet system works.
>
> We're integrated with QuickNode for high-performance RPC and we're building on Light Protocol's ZK compression for the privacy layer.
>
> What's next:
>
> - Token holder dashboard to manage your shadow wallets
> - Batch purchases across multiple tokens
> - Mobile app
> - And full integration with a production privacy pool
>
> We're shipping updates daily and streaming our progress live."

---

### WHY IT MATTERS + CTA (2:30 - 3:00)
*[Camera: You]*

> "Here's why this matters.
>
> Privacy isn't about hiding. It's about fairness.
>
> Right now, the game is rigged against retail traders. Bots and whales have information advantages that regular users can't compete with.
>
> ShadowLaunch levels the playing field. Your trades are your business.
>
> We're building this in public for the Pump.fun hackathon. Follow our progress, try the app, and let us know what you think.
>
> I'm [YOUR NAME]. This is ShadowLaunch.
>
> Privacy-first trading on Pump.fun.
>
> Thanks for watching."

## RECORDING TIPS

### Equipment
- **Camera:** Phone is fine (front camera, good lighting)
- **Audio:** Quiet room, or use earbuds with mic
- **Lighting:** Face a window or use a ring light
- **Background:** Clean, simple (bookshelf, plain wall)

### Delivery
- Speak slightly slower than normal
- Look at the camera lens, not the screen
- Use hand gestures naturally
- It's okay to have cuts - no need for one take

### Screen Recording
- Use QuickTime (Mac) or OBS
- 1920x1080 resolution
- Record the demo portion separately, edit together

### Structure
```
1. Record yourself talking (intro, problem, solution, roadmap, CTA)
2. Record screen demo separately
3. Edit together in iMovie/CapCut/DaVinci Resolve (free)
4. Add simple title cards if needed
5. Export as MP4, 1080p
```
